I’m kinda lazy when it comes to frontend stuff. Playing with design, CSS, all that… not really my thing.

So I went looking for some static site generators, tried a few, and honestly — I just love Jekyll. Super easy to install, quick to set up, and it just works without making me think too much.

Anyway, you can check out the latest updates here. Enjoy :)

and this is my first post.
